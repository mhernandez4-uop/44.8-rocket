# 44.8: Rocket

## Overview
This repository contains all the files required for the Rocket Simulation lab. The purpose of this lab is to simulate rocket characteristics using Python classes and enums. Please follow the instructions below to clone the repository, set up your environment, and run the simulation.

## Files Included
- `Enums.py`: Defines enumerations used in the simulation.

- `C_Rocket.py`: Contains the base class Rocket and its related methods.

- `C_Rocket_hard.py`: Extends the base class with additional functionality.

- `main.py`: Main file to execute the simulation.

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
    
    To get started, clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```python
    git clone https://github.com/mhernandez4-uop/44.8-rocket.git
    cd 44.8-rocket
    ```

2. **Run the Simulation**

    Once inside the repository folder, you can execute the simulation by running `main.py`:

    ```python
    python main.py
    ```

3. **Troubleshooting**

    - Ensure all files are in the same directory, as they import each other.
    
    - If you encounter issues with missing imports, confirm that each file (e.g., `C_Rocket_hard.py`) includes the necessary `from Enums import E` statement at the top.
